Our project focused on the design and implementation of capacitive 
touch buttons as well as management of large quantities of data 
(relative to the MSP430G3553â€™s 512 bytes). We designed a PCB with five 
capacitive touch buttons which interacted with an 8x16 LED grid via SPI to 
play interactive arcade games. In addition to the hardware, we developed a 
capacitive touch library to detect presses from our capacitive touch buttons. 
We designed this library to be easily calibrated for capacitive touch pads 
with different sensitivities.
